## Development Plan for AI-powered Reminder System (Text & Voice) - Containerized Node.js with Dialogflow

This plan outlines the development process for a reminder system using Twilio, Dialogflow (freemium tier), and a containerized Node.js application with Text-to-Speech (TTS) for voice reminders.

**Components:**

1. **Twilio Number:** Your existing Twilio phone number (+44 7822 021078) will handle both SMS and voice calls.
2. **Dialogflow Agent:** Create a Dialogflow agent in Google Cloud Platform to handle user interactions for setting reminders.
3. **Containerized Node.js Backend:** Develop a containerized Node.js application to:
   - Receive SMS messages from Twilio webhooks.
   - Process voice calls using Twilio's Voice API (STT - Speech-to-Text conversion).
   - Send reminder requests to Dialogflow for intent and entity recognition.
   - Generate a JSON response with reminder information (date, time, recipient, message).
   - Optionally, utilize Google Text-to-Speech API to convert reminder messages into audio files for calls.
   - Trigger reminder calls using Twilio's Voice API.

**Development Steps:**

1. **Dialogflow Agent Creation:**

   - Create a new project in Google Cloud Platform (or use an existing one).
   - Navigate to the "Dialogflow" section and create a new agent.
   - Design conversation flows within Dialogflow to guide users through setting reminders:
     - Define an intent for "SetReminder" that captures user requests to set reminders.
     - Train the "SetReminder" intent with various phrases users might use (e.g., "Remind me...", "Call doctor at...").
     - Use entity types in Dialogflow to recognize specific details like date, time, and reminder type (optional).
     - Design follow-up prompts to clarify missing information or confirm reminder details.

2. **Containerized Node.js Backend Development:**

   - Set up a Node.js development environment.
   - Choose a containerization technology like Docker.
   - Install required packages in your Node.js application:
     - Express.js (web framework)
     - Body-parser (parsing request bodies)
     - Twilio Node.js helper library ([https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/reference/twilio-node](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/reference/twilio-node))
     - Dialogflow Node.js client library ([https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/libraries/overview](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/libraries/overview))
     - Google Text-to-Speech API client library ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-to-speech-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-to-speech-js))
   - Develop functionalities:
     - **SMS Processing:**
       - Create an Express.js route to handle incoming SMS messages from Twilio webhooks.
       - Use Body-parser to access the message content.
       - Extract relevant text for the reminder request from the SMS message.
       - Send the extracted text to Dialogflow for intent and entity analysis.
     - **Voice Call Processing:**
       - Use the Twilio Node.js helper library to manage incoming voice calls.
       - Enable Speech-to-Text (STT) transcription on incoming calls.
       - Send the transcribed text from the call to Dialogflow for analysis.
     - **Dialogflow Integration:**
       - Utilize the Dialogflow Node.js client library to communicate with your Dialogflow agent.
       - Send the reminder request text (SMS or voice call transcript) to Dialogflow.
       - Process the Dialogflow response to extract reminder details (date, time, recipient, message).
     - **JSON Response and Reminder Logic:**
       - Generate a JSON response containing the extracted reminder information.
       - Trigger reminder calls using Twilio's Voice API based on the extracted date and time.
       - Optionally, integrate the Google Text-to-Speech API client library to convert reminder messages into audio files for calls.
     - **Error Handling and Logging:**
       - Implement error handling for various scenarios (e.g., Dialogflow errors, Twilio issues).
       - Integrate logging mechanisms for debugging and monitoring.

3. **Twilio Configuration:**

   - Configure your Twilio phone number to:
     - Receive incoming SMS messages and trigger webhooks to your Node.js container.
     - Allow incoming voice calls and enable STT transcription.

4. **Containerization and Deployment:**

   - Create a Dockerfile to build and containerize your Node.js application.
   - Deploy your containerized application to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub) or a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).

**Testing:**

- Thoroughly test the system with various scenarios:
  - Send test SMS messages with different reminder phrases.
  - Make test voice calls with...
